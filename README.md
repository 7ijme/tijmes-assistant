## What is it?
This Discord bot provides you with some fun and useful commands. The best part is, only you will be able to use it.

## Setup
1. Clone this repo
2. Install the dependencies: `npm i`
3. Update the `.env` and `src/.config.json` file.
4. Compile the typescript: `tsc`
5. Run `dist/deployCommandsPublic.js`. You only have to run this when you first cloned  this, or when you create a new command.
6. Run `dist/index.js` from the root of the project

I'd advise using something like `pm2` to keep the node process running while doing other stuff. More info on that [here](https://pm2.keymetrics.io)
